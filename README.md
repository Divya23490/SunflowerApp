# SunflowerApp

Created an Appium Java Project which has the POM - pages file for the locators and the BaseTest for the Appium Service builder configuration. Created the TestNG tests for the 4 test cases which test adding a plant to the cart and validating with excel sheet whether it matches or not.

The second test case is adding the plant Beet and click on share button and then clicking on copy to clipboard.

The third test case covers the negative scenario of adding the plant and clicking on share icon. Then clicking on gmail and selecting creating the account for myself and clicking on next button. The locator for next button, I tried identifying it is correct but somehow it is not able to identify in DOM. I can discuss regarding the same.

In the fourth test I am creating the new gmail account adding the details from the excel sheet picking up the data like firstname, day and year of birth.
